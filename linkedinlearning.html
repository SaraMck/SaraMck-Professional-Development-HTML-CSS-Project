                        <p>During this course, I learned more about critical thinking. </p>
                        <p>The first part about critical thinking that I learned was breaking complicated issues down into smaller, more easily manageable components. This can be used when for instance, when writing a research report on a particular topic, and splitting the report into different sections, and for each section analysing the research, and critically examining the sources and information that you are presenting.</p>
                        <p>The planning fallacy is something else that I was taught about, and how underestimating the time needed to complete something can create major problems.</p>
                        <p>From doing this course, I feel that I will be able to apply critical thinking skills to reports in the future.</p>

                        <p>During this course, I learned about different types of biases that could inhibit problem solving skills.</p>
                        <p>I looked at confirmation bias, and how to avoid creating a conclusion and then basing your analysis and research around that conclusion that you already created. The key part to dealing with this is to look at the information and sources critically and being open to other possible alternatives, to avoid confirmation bias.</p>
                        <p>This course expanded my knowledge of critical thinking and strategic thinking.</p>

                        <p>I learned about the concept of creative thinking. A creative thought is an idea that meets three criteria. It is new, it is useful, and it is surprising. The idea must be new to you but not necessarily new to someone else. Surprising is when you find a good solution and think to yourself “Why didn’t I think of this before?”.</p>
                        <p>Creative thinking is a process that is useful for finding solutions when programming and focusing on creative thinking skills will allow me to improve my code in the future.</p>
